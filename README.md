1.2	Problem Statement:

In the context of Mauritius, one of the key challenges facing the democratic process is the need to modernize and enhance the voting system to make it more accessible, secure, and inclusive for all citizens. The traditional paper-based voting system has its limitations, including potential logistical issues, concerns about transparency, and the exclusion of citizens residing abroad from the voting process. Therefore, there is a pressing need for an innovative e-voting solution that addresses these challenges and ensures a trustworthy and efficient electoral process.

Accessibility and Inclusivity:
The current voting system may present barriers for certain segments of the population, including individuals with disabilities and elderly citizens. Accessibility issues at polling stations, such as physical barriers and lack of assistive technology, can deter some citizens from participating in the voting process. Additionally, citizens living in remote areas may face challenges in accessing polling stations, leading to low voter turnout in those regions.

Exclusion of Citizens Residing Abroad:
Mauritius has a significant diaspora population, with citizens residing abroad who are still invested in the country's affairs and wish to exercise their voting rights. However, the traditional voting system does not provide a feasible mechanism for citizens outside the country to cast their ballots, resulting in their exclusion from the electoral process.

Data Security and Transparency:
Electoral integrity is of utmost importance to maintain citizens' trust in the voting system. The existing paper-based voting process may be vulnerable to errors, fraud, or tampering. Moreover, ensuring transparency in the counting and tabulation of votes can be a challenging task, raising concerns about the accuracy and fairness of the final results.



Logistical Challenges:
Organizing and managing elections with a large voter base can be logistically demanding and time-consuming. Distributing ballot papers, establishing polling stations, and processing paper ballots can lead to delays and potential errors in the electoral process.

Low Voter Turnout:
Mauritius has experienced declining voter turnout in recent years, indicating a lack of engagement and participation in the electoral process. Encouraging citizens to vote and fostering a sense of civic responsibility are essential to strengthen democracy in the country.

Natural Disasters and Emergencies:
Mauritius is prone to natural disasters and emergencies, such as cyclones and other calamities. These events can disrupt the traditional voting process, potentially affecting citizens' ability to cast their votes.

To address these challenges, the proposed MUvote project aims to develop an advanced e-voting application that leverages modern technologies, such as React.js, PHP, SHA 256 encryption, 5G telecommunication, and inclusive design principles. The primary goal is to create a secure, convenient, and transparent e-voting platform that accommodates citizens both within Mauritius and residing abroad. By providing accessible voting options, enhancing data security, and promoting voter engagement, MUvote seeks to revolutionize the electoral process in Mauritius and reinforce citizens' faith in the democratic system 

1.3	Project Aims

The adoption of modern voting methods, including electronic and online systems, has significantly transformed the electoral process, offering benefits such as increased efficiency, accessibility, and faster results. However, this transition has also introduced a critical challenge: the vulnerability of modern voting systems to cybersecurity threats. Ensuring the security, integrity, and authenticity of elections is of paramount importance to uphold democratic values and prevent potential breaches that could undermine the credibility of election outcomes. My project  Enhancing Modern Voting through Cybersecurity Monitoring seeks to address these challenges by developing a robust cybersecurity framework tailored for the unique requirements of modern voting systems.

Problem Statement:
The implementation of modern voting methods in Mauritius has given rise to concerns about the susceptibility of electronic and online voting systems to cybersecurity risks. As these systems handle sensitive voter data and determine the outcome of democratic processes, ensuring their security against malicious actors, tampering, and unauthorized access has become an urgent imperative. The lack of comprehensive cybersecurity measures tailored to modern voting systems in Mauritius poses a significant threat to the integrity of elections and the public's trust in the democratic process.

Challenges:

•	Cyber Threats and Attacks: Modern voting systems are susceptible to a range of cyber threats, including hacking, data breaches, denial-of-service attacks, and unauthorized access. These threats can compromise voter data, manipulate election results, and erode public confidence.

•	Vulnerabilities in Infrastructure: Inadequate security measures in the underlying infrastructure of modern voting systems could expose vulnerabilities that cybercriminals could exploit to manipulate or disrupt the voting process.

•	Data Integrity and Authenticity: Ensuring the accuracy and authenticity of voter data, ballots, and election results is crucial. Any compromise in data integrity could lead to contested outcomes and legal challenges.

•	Lack of Real-time Monitoring: Existing voting systems often lack real-time monitoring and alert mechanisms, leaving authorities unaware of potential cyber incidents until it's too late to mitigate them effectively.

•	Public Trust: The lack of robust cybersecurity measures can erode public trust in the electoral process, leading to skepticism about the fairness and validity of election outcomes.

Project Objectives:
The primary objectives of the Enhancing Modern Voting through Cybersecurity Monitoring project are:

1.	To design and develop a comprehensive cybersecurity framework tailored for modern voting systems in Mauritius.
2.	To implement advanced security measures that safeguard voter data, prevent tampering, and ensure the authenticity of election results.
3.	To create a real-time monitoring system that detects and alerts authorities about potential cyber threats or anomalies.
4.	To establish mechanisms for recording and maintaining detailed audit trails to enhance transparency and accountability within the voting process.
5.	To raise awareness among stakeholders about the importance of cybersecurity in preserving the integrity of elections.
